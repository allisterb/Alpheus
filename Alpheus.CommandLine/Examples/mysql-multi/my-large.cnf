# This is for large system with memory = 512M where the system runs mainly
# MySQL.

# You can copy this file to
# /etc/my.cnf to set global options,
# mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to set server-specific options (in this
# installation this directory is /var/lib/mysql) or
# ~/.my.cnf to set user-specific options.

# One can in this file use all long options that the program supports.
# If you want to know which options a program support, run the program
# with --help option.
